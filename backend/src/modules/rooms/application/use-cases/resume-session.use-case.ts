 * Puts a player back online without a token: the socket that comes back
 * through Socket.IO's connection state recovery *is* the previous socket, so
 * there is nothing to authenticate. It is `room:rejoin` minus the token check
 * and minus the state ack — the recovered socket already got the events it
 * missed.
 *
 * Returns false when the room or the seat is gone (the player left, was
 * kicked, or the room was deleted); the client then has to rejoin properly
 * and hears `session_expired`.
