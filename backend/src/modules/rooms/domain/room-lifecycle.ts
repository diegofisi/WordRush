/**
 * How long a room survives without anybody connected.
 * Single source of truth for `docs/context/02-game-rules.md` ->
 * "Disconnections and room lifetime". Rooms live in memory and weigh a few KB;
 * these delays are hygiene, not cost. The frontend does not need them, so they
 * stay out of the socket contract.
 *
 * A disconnected player is **never** removed from a live room (decided
 * 2026-09-17): they stay listed with `connected: false` and come back to the
 * same seat. Only leaving, being kicked, or the whole room going away frees a
 * seat. What the janitor still does is delete rooms nobody is in.
